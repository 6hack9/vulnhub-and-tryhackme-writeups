# vulnhub-writeups

Write-ups of the vulnhub VMs I have done.

I work as a security consultant for Aura infosec in wellington, where my role is primarily defensive/advisory/analysis related. Hacking is handled by our pentesters, but I want to learn it as well. My background however is primarily software development (as can be seen in my other repos on github), and on windows at that, so my hacking skills started from basically zero.

In that vein, amongst many other resources (over the wire, tonnes of books etc), vulnhub is a great resource! And really fun, too. The actual experience of hacking against an otherwise opaque box, learning different techniques for all the stages of a compromise, is amazing.

The writeups are numbered in the order I did them.

I also reserve the right to use `hacktheplanet`, `zerocool`, `acidburn` etc as passwords or new users while I do so.
